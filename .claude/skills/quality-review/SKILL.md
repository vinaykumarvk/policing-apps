# Code Quality & Completeness Review

Perform an end-to-end code quality and functional completeness review and produce a prioritized, actionable improvement plan with a quality verdict.

## Scoping

If the user specifies a target (example: `/quality-review apps/api`), review only that app or package. Otherwise review the full codebase.

If the user specifies a phase (example: `/quality-review api only`), run only that section.
Valid phase keywords: `preflight`, `discover`, `completeness`, `api`, `database`, `errors`, `testing`, `quality`, `i18n`, `gates`, `bugs`, `backlog`, `quickwins`.

If target includes `/`, generate a safe output slug: replace `/` with `-`, remove spaces.

## Operating Rules

- Evidence-first: cite exact files and line numbers.
- Separate `confirmed` evidence from `inferred` conclusions.
- Never claim a check passed unless you ran or inspected it.
- If evidence is missing, state the gap and how to obtain it.
- Every recommendation must include: `what`, `where`, `how`, and `verify`.
- Prefer small, reversible fixes; propose phased migration for larger refactors.
- Recommend one default path when options exist; give short rationale.
- Prioritize: Data correctness -> Functional gaps -> Error handling -> API contracts -> Test coverage -> Maintainability.
- Save final report to `docs/reviews/quality-review-{targetSlug}-{YYYY-MM-DD}.md`.

## Quality Bar (Definition of Done)

The review is complete only when all are present:

- Codebase structure map with module inventory.
- Functional completeness assessment against requirements (if available).
- Findings for all requested categories with evidence.
- Every finding has severity, confidence, and verification steps.
- QA gate scorecard with `PASS` / `PARTIAL` / `FAIL`.
- Quality verdict (`SOLID` / `NEEDS-WORK` / `AT-RISK`) with blocking issues listed.
- Prioritized improvement backlog and quick-win plan.

## Severity, Confidence, and Risk

Use these fields for every finding:

- `Severity`: `P0` (urgent — data loss or corruption risk), `P1` (high — fix this sprint), `P2` (medium — next sprint), `P3` (low — cleanup/hardening)
- `Confidence`: `High` (direct evidence), `Medium` (strong inference), `Low` (hypothesis)
- `Status`: `Confirmed`, `Partially Confirmed`, `Unverified`

Risk scoring:

`Risk Score = Impact (1-5) x Likelihood (1-5)`

---

## Phase 0: Preflight

Before deep analysis, capture:

- Scope, assumptions, and explicit exclusions.
- Current commit hash and branch.
- Tech stack discovery: languages, frameworks, ORMs, validation libraries, test frameworks.
- Available quality scripts (test, lint, typecheck, format, coverage).
- Requirements documents location (BRD, SRS, user stories, epics) — if any.
- Environment constraints (missing databases, APIs, test fixtures).

Output a preflight block so readers understand confidence boundaries.

## Phase 1: Codebase Discovery

Scan and document:

- Module inventory: apps, packages, services, libraries.
- Dependency graph: which modules depend on which.
- Shared code: reusable packages, utilities, types.
- Entry points: API servers, CLI tools, UI apps, workers, cron jobs.
- Configuration patterns: env vars, config files, feature flags.
- Build and output structure.

Include a module map (table or diagram) showing component relationships.

## Phase 2: Functional Completeness

### A) Requirements Mapping

If requirements documents exist:

- Inventory all functional requirements.
- Map each to implementation evidence (route, component, service, migration).
- Identify: implemented, partially implemented, not implemented, and over-implemented (scope creep).

Produce a completeness matrix:

| Requirement ID | Description | Implementation Evidence | Status | Gaps | Notes |
|----------------|-------------|------------------------|--------|------|-------|

Status: `Complete`, `Partial`, `Missing`, `Over-Implemented`, `Unable to Verify`.

### B) Feature Coverage (Code-Inferred)

If no requirements docs, infer feature coverage from code:

- Route inventory: all CRUD and business-logic endpoints.
- Entity coverage: create, read, update, delete, list, search for each domain entity.
- Workflow/state-machine completeness: all states reachable, all transitions implemented.
- UI screen coverage: all routes have corresponding views with data binding.

### C) Business Logic Gaps

- Edge cases: boundary conditions, empty states, max-value scenarios.
- Workflow transitions: unreachable states, missing guard conditions, dead-end states.
- Data consistency: operations that should be transactional but are not.
- Feature parity: multi-tenant/multi-role features that work for one role but not others.

### D) Integration Completeness

- Frontend-to-API alignment: every UI action has a corresponding API endpoint.
- API response shapes match frontend expectations (types, field names, pagination).
- Error responses from API are handled in frontend (not just happy path).
- Cross-service communication: all expected integrations are wired.

## Phase 3: API Contract Quality

### A) Route Design and Consistency

- RESTful conventions: resource naming, HTTP method usage, status codes.
- Consistent URL patterns across all API modules.
- Consistent response envelope (success and error shapes).
- Pagination, filtering, and sorting patterns are uniform.
- Idempotency for mutation endpoints (PUT, DELETE).

### B) Schema Validation

- All request bodies validated against schemas before processing.
- All path/query parameters validated and typed.
- Validation errors return structured, actionable error messages.
- Schema reuse: shared schemas for common patterns (pagination, ID params, timestamps).
- No `any` types or unvalidated request body access.

### C) Error Contract

- Consistent error response format across all endpoints.
- HTTP status codes used correctly (not 200 for errors, not 500 for client errors).
- Error messages are user-safe (no stack traces, internal paths, or SQL in responses).
- Domain errors are distinguishable from system errors.
- Error codes are documented or self-describing.

### D) API Documentation and Discoverability

- OpenAPI/Swagger spec exists or is auto-generated from schemas.
- Route handlers have clear parameter and return type annotations.
- Undocumented endpoints or parameters flagged.

## Phase 4: Database and Data Layer Quality

### A) Schema Design

- Tables have appropriate primary keys (UUID vs serial, consistency).
- Foreign keys with proper referential integrity constraints.
- Indexes exist for frequently queried columns and join conditions.
- Appropriate use of constraints: NOT NULL, UNIQUE, CHECK.
- Consistent naming conventions (snake_case, singular/plural, prefix conventions).
- Soft-delete vs hard-delete approach is consistent.

### B) Migration Quality

- Migrations are ordered and non-conflicting.
- Each migration is idempotent (can run twice without error) — uses `IF NOT EXISTS`, `IF EXISTS`.
- No destructive operations without a migration rollback plan.
- Migrations do not modify data in ways that break running application code (backward compatible).
- Seed data is separate from schema migrations.
- Migration file naming follows a consistent convention.

### C) Query Quality

- No N+1 query patterns (list endpoint that queries per item).
- Joins preferred over sequential queries where appropriate.
- Transactions used for multi-step mutations (not partial commit risks).
- Connection pooling configured with appropriate limits.
- No unbounded queries (missing LIMIT/pagination on list endpoints).
- Raw SQL is parameterized (no string interpolation with user input).

### D) Data Integrity

- Business invariants enforced at the database level (not just application code).
- Unique constraints for naturally unique fields (email, reference numbers).
- Cascading deletes/updates are intentional and correct.
- Audit fields (created_at, updated_at, created_by) consistently present.
- Timestamps use consistent timezone handling (UTC preferred).

## Phase 5: Error Handling and Resilience

### A) Error Handling Patterns

- All async operations have error handling (try/catch, `.catch()`, error middleware).
- Global error handler exists and catches unhandled exceptions.
- Errors are logged with sufficient context (request ID, user ID, stack trace).
- Error handling does not swallow errors silently (`catch(e) {}` anti-pattern).
- Promise rejections are always handled (no unhandled promise rejections).

### B) Graceful Degradation

- External service failures are handled (API calls, database, file storage, queues).
- Timeout configuration for all external calls.
- Circuit breaker or retry patterns for unreliable dependencies.
- Fallback behavior defined for non-critical feature failures.
- SIGTERM/SIGINT handlers for graceful shutdown.

### C) Validation and Boundary Errors

- Input validation errors return helpful messages (not generic 500).
- File upload errors handled: too large, wrong type, corrupt file.
- Pagination boundary errors: negative page, page beyond results.
- Concurrent modification handling (optimistic locking or last-write-wins with awareness).

### D) Frontend Error Handling

- API errors displayed meaningfully to users (not raw JSON or stack traces).
- Network failure states: offline banner, retry mechanisms, cached data display.
- Error boundaries catch component crashes (React ErrorBoundary or equivalent).
- Form submission errors: field-level feedback, not just toast messages.
- Loading and error states for every data-fetching component.

## Phase 6: Testing and Quality Gates

### A) Test Coverage and Depth

- Unit test presence for core business logic (services, utilities, validators).
- Integration test presence for API routes (request/response verification).
- End-to-end test presence for critical user journeys.
- Test coverage percentage (if measurable): flag modules below 50%.

### B) Test Quality

- Tests assert behavior, not implementation details.
- Tests are deterministic (no time-dependent, order-dependent, or flaky tests).
- Test data setup is isolated (no shared mutable state between tests).
- Negative cases tested (invalid input, unauthorized access, missing data).
- Edge cases tested (empty collections, max values, concurrent operations).

### C) Test Infrastructure

- Tests can run locally without external dependencies (mocks/fixtures).
- CI pipeline runs tests on every PR/push.
- Test failures block merge/deploy.
- Test execution time is reasonable (not blocking developer productivity).

### D) Static Analysis

- TypeScript strict mode (or equivalent type checking) enabled.
- Linter configured and enforced (ESLint, Pylint, etc.).
- Formatter configured and enforced (Prettier, Black, etc.).
- No lint/type suppressions (`// @ts-ignore`, `// eslint-disable`) without explanatory comment.
- Type safety: minimal use of `any`, `unknown` is preferred over `any` where types are unclear.

## Phase 7: Code Maintainability

### A) Dead Code and Unused Exports

- Unused imports detected across the codebase.
- Exported functions/types/constants that are never imported.
- Unreachable code paths (after early returns, in disabled branches).
- Commented-out code blocks (should be removed or tracked as TODOs).
- Files not imported anywhere (orphaned modules).

### B) Duplication

- Repeated utility functions across modules.
- Copy-pasted handlers/components with minor variations.
- Duplicated type definitions that should be in shared packages.
- Repeated configuration patterns that could be abstracted.

### C) Naming and Organization

- Consistent naming conventions across the codebase.
- Clear module boundaries and responsibility separation.
- File organization follows a discoverable pattern.
- Naming reflects domain language (not implementation details).

### D) Complexity Hotspots

- Functions exceeding ~50 lines (candidates for extraction).
- Files exceeding ~500 lines (candidates for splitting).
- Deeply nested conditionals (>3 levels — candidates for early returns or extraction).
- High cyclomatic complexity functions.
- God objects or modules with too many responsibilities.

### E) Technical Debt Indicators

- TODO/FIXME/HACK comments inventory.
- Temporary workarounds that became permanent.
- Version pinning with comments about compatibility issues.
- Feature flags or conditional logic for deprecated features.

## Phase 8: Internationalization and Content Quality

### A) i18n Coverage

- All user-visible text uses i18n functions (no hardcoded strings in UI components).
- Translation keys exist in all required locale files.
- No missing translations (keys present in one locale but not others).
- Dynamic content (interpolation, pluralization) handled correctly.

### B) i18n Pattern Compliance

- Consistent use of i18n utilities across the codebase.
- Labels, headings, and messages follow the project's i18n conventions.
- Date, number, and currency formatting use locale-aware utilities.
- Error messages are translatable (not hardcoded English in API responses shown to users).

### C) Content Quality

- Error messages are actionable (tell the user what to do, not just what went wrong).
- Consistent tone and terminology across the application.
- No placeholder or lorem ipsum text remaining.
- Technical jargon not exposed to end users.

## Phase 9: QA Gates and Quality Verdict

Assess each gate as `PASS`, `PARTIAL`, `FAIL`.

Blocking gates:

1. **Functional completeness** — Core features implemented and wired end-to-end.
2. **Data integrity** — Transactions, constraints, and validation protect data correctness.
3. **API contracts** — Consistent schemas, error envelopes, and status codes.
4. **Error handling** — No silent failures; errors surfaced and handled at every layer.
5. **Type safety** — Strict types; minimal `any`; no untyped API boundaries.
6. **Critical-path tests** — Core business logic and key user journeys have test coverage.
7. **Build health** — Build succeeds cleanly; no warnings treated as acceptable.

Non-blocking gates:

1. **Test depth** — Coverage beyond critical paths; edge cases and negative cases.
2. **Code maintainability** — Low duplication, clear naming, manageable complexity.
3. **i18n completeness** — All user-facing text internationalized where required.
4. **Documentation** — API docs, code comments for non-obvious logic.

Verdict policy:

- Any blocking gate `FAIL` => `AT-RISK`.
- Blocking gates all `PASS` or `PARTIAL` with no `FAIL` and 2+ `PARTIAL` => `NEEDS-WORK`.
- Blocking gates all `PASS` with at most 1 `PARTIAL` => `SOLID`.

Verdict block:

```text
Functional Status:     [PASS | PARTIAL | FAIL]
Data Integrity:        [PASS | PARTIAL | FAIL]
API Contracts:         [PASS | PARTIAL | FAIL]
Error Handling:        [PASS | PARTIAL | FAIL]
Blocking Gates:        X/7 PASS, Y/7 PARTIAL, Z/7 FAIL
Non-Blocking Gates:    X/4 PASS, Y/4 PARTIAL, Z/4 FAIL
Quality Verdict:       [SOLID | NEEDS-WORK | AT-RISK]
```

## Phase 10: Bugs and Foot-Guns

Minimum counts:

- Full-repo review: `10+` high-impact and `10+` medium-impact findings.
- Scoped review: `5+` high-impact and `5+` medium-impact findings.

Each finding must include:

- Severity, confidence, and status.
- Exact file:line evidence.
- Impact statement (data loss, incorrect behavior, user-facing bug, etc.).
- Specific fix with code-level guidance.
- Verification steps.

## Phase 11: Requirements Compliance Matrix

If requirements documents are available, produce:

| Requirement ID | Description | Implementation Evidence | Status | Gap | Next Step |
|----------------|-------------|------------------------|--------|------|-----------|

If no formal requirements, produce a feature-coverage matrix based on inferred domain model.

## Phase 12: Improvement Backlog

Backlog size:

- Full-repo: `25-50` items.
- Scoped: `10-25` items.

| ID | Title | Priority | Risk Score | Effort | Category | Where | Why | Fix | Verify | Dependencies |
|----|-------|----------|------------|--------|----------|-------|-----|-----|--------|--------------|

Priority:

- `P0`: urgent — data correctness or critical functionality gap.
- `P1`: high — fix this sprint.
- `P2`: medium — next sprint.
- `P3`: low — cleanup/hardening.

Effort:

- `S`: under 2 hours.
- `M`: 2 hours to 2 days.
- `L`: more than 2 days.

## Phase 13: Quick Wins and Stabilization

- Quick wins (2 hours): `5-10` fixes with immediate quality improvement.
- 2-day stabilization: `8-15` fixes that materially improve reliability and correctness.

Each task must include exact file targets and verification steps.

## Phase 14: Verification Commands

Adapt commands to the discovered tech stack. Examples:

```bash
# Type checking
npx tsc --noEmit 2>&1 | head -50
# or: mypy . --ignore-missing-imports

# Linting
npx eslint . --max-warnings=0 2>&1 | tail -20
# or: ruff check .

# Test execution
npm test 2>&1 | tail -30
# or: pytest --tb=short

# Test coverage (if configured)
npm run test:coverage 2>&1 | tail -20

# Dead code detection
rg -n "export (function|const|class|type|interface) " --glob '*.ts' --glob '*.tsx' | head -50
# Then cross-reference: are these exports imported anywhere?

# TODO/FIXME inventory
rg -n "TODO|FIXME|HACK|XXX|TEMP" --glob '!node_modules' --glob '!*.lock'

# Unused imports (TypeScript)
rg -n "^import .* from" --glob '*.ts' --glob '*.tsx' | head -30

# N+1 query patterns
rg -n "for.*await.*query\(|\.forEach.*await.*find" --glob '*.ts' --glob '*.js'

# Missing error handling
rg -n "\.catch\(\(\) => \{\}\)|catch\s*\(e?\)\s*\{\s*\}" --glob '*.ts' --glob '*.js'

# Any type usage
rg -n ": any\b|as any\b" --glob '*.ts' --glob '*.tsx'

# Hardcoded strings in UI (potential i18n misses)
rg -n '>[A-Z][a-z].*</' --glob '*.tsx' --glob '*.jsx' | head -30

# Build verification
npm run build 2>&1 | tail -20
```

Record each command as `Executed` or `Not Executed` with reason.
